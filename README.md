UFOClock draws an astronomical clock. From it you can read the time of day, phase of the lunar month, ratio of day to night, time until a solstice or equinox, and time until the end or beginning of twilight. The time of day depends on your location on the surface of the Earth, which you can enter on the command line or in a dotfile in your home directory. Location can be given as latitude/longitude or ZIP code. It is called UFO clock because it sort of looks like crop circles. It is based on Sundial by George Williams. It requires GLUT installed to run and the NOVAS library to build.
